## Stellee Notifications

Stellee is a mobile app developed by High Stakes and DigitalFit that provides real-time notifications about a variety of on-chain events and news.
Its engineering stems from an observation that all crypto holders have made: it is difficult to keep up with all the projects that we are following, and of all the assets that we possess.
Joining many Telegram and Discord groups, subscribing to newsletters, following accounts on X, only leads to drowning in dozens of notifications that are mostly irrelevant to the point of missing the important ones.

Stellee allows one to select what he wishes to be informed of, centralizing all the notifications in a single place and ensuring that no essential information is ever missed again. 

Users can subscribe to **public channels** : for example news & announcements shared by teams and foundations, or chain governance to be informed when a proposal enters the voting period.

They can also subscribe to **private alerts** which are related to the activity on specific wallets : tokens sent or received, IBC transfer executed, validator changing their commission or being jailed, etc.

A key element is that none of the susbcriptions ever requires providing any personal information like email address, phone number or any kind of id. Subscriptions are done in an absolutely anonymous way, web3-style.

Let's explore its features!
