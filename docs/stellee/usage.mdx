Once you have installed the app on your device, you can start subscribing to public channels and setting up your private alerts.

## Public channels

The public subscriptions can be done on the [official website](https://stellee.highstakes.ch/get-started#channels), by scanning the relevant QR codes directly in Stellee. No extra steps are required.
The "News" channels relay the annoucements posted by the teams in their official Discord group, and the "Governance" ones monitor the on-chain proposals so that you don't miss an important vote. 

## Private messages

At this time, you can get private notifications (i.e. related to a specific wallet) only if you own the wallet. This restriction will be lifted soon.

To set up these notifications, you must head to the [High Stakes dashboard](https://app.highstakes.ch/notifications) from a desktop browser with a wallet installed (Keplr, Leap...), and follow the below steps:

#### 1. Connect your wallet

#### 2. If it is your first visit to this dashboard, your wallet will prompt you to accept the connection to Cosmos

#### 3. You can already subscribe to the public channels for the supported chains

#### 4. Now you can set up the private notifications
üë®‚Äçüè´ In this example, Axone is not yet natively supported by the wallets. If you didn't add it manually yet, the interface will request to do so -- click on **Approve**

#### 5. Select the events you would like to be informed about
üí° To select all the events from a category at once, click on the title : "Account Activity", "Validator Events"

<img src={step_5}></img>

#### 6. Click on "Subscribe" and approve the wallet prompt
ü•∑üèΩ This proves that this wallet belongs to you -- as mentioned above, this restriction will be lifted soon.

#### 7. Finally, scan the QR code from Stellee on your mobile device
(the "Scan code" button in Stellee's bottom bar)
