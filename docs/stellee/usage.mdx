# Using Stellee

Once the app is installed on your mobile device, you can start subscribing to **public channels** and setting up **private alerts**.

---

## Public Channels

Public subscriptions are the easiest way to get started.  
Go to the [official website](https://stellee.highstakes.ch/get-started#channels) and scan the relevant QR codes directly in the app.  

- **News channels**: relay announcements from teams (via their official Discord).  
- **Governance channels**: notify you when proposals enter the voting period, so you never miss an important vote.  

That‚Äôs it! No extra setup required. ‚úÖ  

---

## Private Alerts

Private alerts are linked to a specific wallet.  
Currently, you can only set these up if you own the wallet (this restriction will be lifted soon).

To subscribe, open the [High Stakes dashboard](https://app.highstakes.ch/notifications) in a **desktop browser with a wallet extension** (Keplr, Leap, etc.) or through the **integrated browser in your mobile wallet**, and follow these steps:

---

### 1. Connect your wallet

### 2. Approve the connection
If this is your first visit, your wallet will ask you to connect to Cosmos. Click **Approve**.

---

### 3. Subscribe to public channels (optional)
From the dashboard, you can already subscribe to public channels for supported chains.

---

### 4. Set up private notifications
üë®‚Äçüè´ Example: Axone isn‚Äôt natively supported by most wallets yet. If you haven‚Äôt added it manually, you‚Äôll be prompted ‚Äî just click **Approve**.

---

### 5. Choose the events to follow
üí° Tip: To select all events in a category at once, click the category title (e.g. *Account Activity*, *Validator Events*).  
<img src={step_5} />

---

### 6. Subscribe & approve
Click **Subscribe** and approve the prompt in your wallet.  
ü•∑üèΩ This step confirms ownership of the wallet (temporary requirement).  
<img src={step_6} />

---

### 7. Link with Stellee
Open the app on your phone, tap **Scan code** (bottom bar), and scan the QR code shown on the dashboard.  
<img src={step_7} />

üéâ Done! You‚Äôll now receive your selected notifications directly on your mobile device.

If you want to learn more about Stellee, you can also head to its [official website](https://stellee.highstakes.ch). 
Once the wallet ownership restriction is lifted, this is where all the action will take place -- subscribing to public and private alerts alike.
