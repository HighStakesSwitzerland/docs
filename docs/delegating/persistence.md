## ❓ FAQ

:::info What are Persistence staking reward rates?
The current rate is 23%, taking into account our validator commission of 5%.

:::info Are there any risks when delegating?

:::info How does Persistence service fee work?
The protocol automatically pays a commission to all active validators participating in the minting of new blocks. It is a percentage on all rewards earned related to the staking power of each validator.

:::info Can I vote on governance proposals?
Yes, all users with staked tokens can vote on any proposal using Keplr or another wallet.
Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators, but the votes of the users override them.
