## Wallet choices

Secret Network is supported by multiple wallets including [Keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app/){target=_blank}, [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com){target=_blank}, [Fina](https://fina.cash){target=_blank} and [Kryptic](https://kryptic.io){target=_blank}.

## How to stake

Open the [Keplr app](https://wallet.keplr.app/chains/secret-network) and click on **Staking**.

1. Search for High Stakes in the list of validators and click on **Manage**. A new window will appear.

2. Click on **Delegate** and fill out the amount you want to delegate, then confirm by clicking on **Delegate** again.

4. Always keep some coins to pay fees with. Never stake your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can’t make any transactions!

Congratulations, you’ve just delegated SCRT!

## FAQ

??? note "What are Secret Network staking reward rates?"

    The current rate is 22.20%, taking into account our validator commission of 5%.

??? note "Are there any risks when delegating?"

    Slashing is enabled, meaning any validator misbehaving can lose a portion of their tokens, plus the delegated ones.

    In case of prolonged downtime, the slashing amount is 0.01% once. In case of double sign, it is 5% and the validator is forever banned.

??? note "How does Secret Network service fee work?"

    The protocol automatically pays a commission to all active validators participating in the minting of new blocks. It is a percentage on all rewards earned related to the staking power of each validator.

??? note "Can I vote on governance proposals?"

    Yes, all users with staked tokens can vote on any proposal using Keplr or another wallet.
    Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators, but it is overridden by the votes of the users.
