## ❓ FAQ

:::info What are Iris staking reward rates?
The current rate is 7.00%, taking into account our validator commission of 8%.
:::

:::info Are there any risks when delegating?
Slashing is enabled, meaning any validator misbehaving can lose a portion of their tokens, plus the delegated ones.
In case of prolonged downtime, the slashing amount is 0.01% once. In case of double sign, it is 5% and the validator is forever banned.
:::

:::info How does Iris service fee work?
The protocol automatically pays a commission to all active validators participating in the minting of new blocks. It is a percentage on all rewards earned related to the staking power of each validator.
:::

:::info Can I vote on governance proposals?
Yes, all users with staked tokens can vote on any proposal using Keplr or another wallet.
Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators, but the votes of the users override them.
