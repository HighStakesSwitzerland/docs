## ❓ FAQ

:::info What are Provenance staking reward rates?
The current rate is about 10%, taking into account our validator commission of 10%.
:::

:::info Are there any risks when delegating?
Slashing is enabled, meaning any validator misbehaving can lose a portion of their tokens, plus the delegated ones.
In case of prolonged downtime, the slashing amount is 0.01% once. In case of double sign, it is 5% and the validator is forever banned.
:::

:::info How does Provenance service fee work?
The protocol automatically pays a commission to all active validators participating in the minting of new blocks. It is a percentage on all rewards earned related to the staking power of each validator.
:::

:::info Can I vote on governance proposals?
Yes, all users with staked tokens can vote on any proposal using Keplr or another wallet.
Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators, but the votes of the users override them.
