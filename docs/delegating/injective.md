## ❓ FAQ

:::info Which wallets are currently supported?
Currently Metamask, Keplr, Torus, Ledger and Trezor are supported.
:::

:::info Do I need ETH to pay for Gas fees?
Yes, but only for the approval, deposit, and withdrawal of your tokens when performing transactions through Ethereum.
:::

:::info Can I stake using a Ledger?
Yes, Injective has native integration, and you can stake directly with a Ledger.
:::

:::info Are there any risks when delegating?
Slashing is enabled, meaning any validator misbehaving can lose a portion of their tokens, plus the delegated ones.
In case of prolonged downtime, the slashing amount is 0.01% once. In case of double sign, it is 5% and the validator is forever banned.
:::

:::info How does Injective service fee work?
The protocol automatically pays a commission to all active validators participating in the minting of new blocks. It is a percentage on all rewards earned related to the staking power of each validator.
:::

:::info Can I vote on governance proposals?
Yes, all users with staked tokens can vote on any proposal using their wallet.
Validators are able to cast votes on behalf of their delegators, but it is overridden by the votes of the users.
