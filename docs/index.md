:::caution "Security disclaimer"
Always make sure of the URL of the website before signing a transaction with your wallet. 
Fake websites impersonating wallets or UIs are circulating over the internet.  

Using non-custodial wallets mean you stay in control of your seed phrases or secret keys, and as such, you have the responsibility of safeguarding them.
