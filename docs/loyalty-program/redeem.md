# Redeeming Your IBEX Points for ATOM

Once you've earned enough IBEX points, you can redeem them for ATOM on the HighStakes platform. Here's how:

## Go to the "Rewards" Tab

When you have enough IBEX points available, go to the "Rewards" tab on the HighStakes platform.

## Redeem Your Points

Click the "Redeem" button and sign the message to initiate the transaction.

There are 2 situations:

- If you have at least 250 IBEX available, the redeem is immediate and you will receive the corresponding ATOMs within seconds.
- If you have at least 50 IBEX: the interface lets you redeem, however the transaction will be executed along another (or multiple others) as a _multisend transaction_, when the overall amount exceeds 250 IBEX. This is the **asynchronous redeem** that allows users to retrieve their IBEX even when they earn only a handful daily points.
- As a result, the ATOMs may take a little while to land on your wallet (usually a couple hours at most).

## Receive Your ATOMs!

That's it! Depending on whether the you have redeemed more or less than 250 IBEX, you will see the ATOMs land in the Cosmos wallet associated immediately or after a delay.
