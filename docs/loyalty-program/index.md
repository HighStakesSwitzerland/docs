# High Stakes Switzerland's IBEX Loyalty Program

With the IBEX Program, [High Stakes]([https://highstakes.ch)' delegators have an opportunity to boost their staking rewards by earning a share of the yield of a Staking Fund that belongs to the company.

This fund, which is held in ATOM and staked on our Cosmos validator, generates staking rewards that are withdrawn and distributed to the registered users, prorated to the overall USD value of the tokens they stake on any of the eligible validators operated by High Stakes.

The users earn IBEX loyalty points that are accrued each day, and can redeem them against ATOM as soon as they hold 250 IBEX. The current conversion rate is 1000 IBEX = 1 ATOM.


## How it works

Participants can register by connecting a wallet (either through Cosmostation or Keplr), and are identified by the Secret Network address associated to this account.

They can afterwards activate any available network: the staked amount will be picked up and used to calculate their IBEX allocation.
All delegators can register, however they can start earning IBEX points only if they stake overall at least $1000.

Each day, the IBEX points earned will be calculated and allocated; their amount will vary based on the changes in the user's delegations, exchange rates, and other participants. A quadratic function is used to ensure that "whales" do not earn a disproportionate amount of the daily available IBEX.

When participants redeem their IBEX points, the corresponding ATOM amount is transferred to the Cosmos wallet associated with their account -- which means that they need to activate the Cosmos chain after registering to the program. 

## What if a user stakes through wallets that do not have the same seed?

For security reasons, most of us have different wallets and seed phrases for our different tokens.

If a user delegates the following amounts:

  - 800 USD worth of ATOM from an account,
  - 600 USD worth of INJ from another, 
  - 900 USD worth of BAND from yet another,

He will register each of these account but none of them will be eligible to earn IBEX since their individual staked value is below $1000.

The participants have the opportunity to _link their different registered accounts_, in which case the value of the delegations from the different accounts will be summed up.
In the above example, the user will be staking 800+600+900 = 2300 USD worth of tokens, and will receive his daily share of IBEX points.

Head to the appropriate [section](https://docs.highstakes.ch/loyalty-program/link/) to learn how to proceed.

## Rewarding the long-term stakers

Each year in December, a variable amount of ATOMs will be distributed to all the participants, prorated to the IBEX points they earned over the past year, and the number of days they delegated to High Stakes.

The allocated amount of allocated ATOMs will depend on the overall financial results of the company and global market trends, but we will ensure that those who have been loyal to us receive a reward that matches our gratefulness.

## The initial airdrop

We have taken snapshots of our delegators over the past months, and will allocate an initial amount of IBEX points to all the participants that register when the program launches, in proportion to the USD value of their delegations and the time they have been staking with us.
This airdrop will be calculated in a few weeks, once enough users have registered. Stay tuned!
