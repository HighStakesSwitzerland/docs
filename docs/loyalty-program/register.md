We are currently in the process of integrating additional wallets onto our platform, as well as providing mobile support. Stay tuned for updates!

## Registration
Before registering, please take a moment to read and review our Terms and Conditions. 

To register, you will need to sign a small JSON message with your wallet.
This message serves as proof of ownership that you own the wallet and its seed phrase.

:::tip
Signing a custom message with your wallet does not pose any risks, as it is not a transaction on the blockchain. We are only using this as a proof of ownership.
