# Linking Multiple Wallets

If you stake from different wallets (i.e., different seeds), you can link them to combine staked amounts and calculate overall IBEX points. This is especially helpful if you stake less than $1000, the minimum amount required to be eligible for IBEX points, on each wallet.

## Linking Your Wallets

To link your wallets, follow these steps:

1. Click on "link" and sign the first message with your primary wallet.

2. Switch to the other wallet in Keplr or Cosmostation (which must also be registered), and sign a second message to confirm the link.

Once you've completed these steps, your IBEX points will be shared between all linked wallets. ðŸš€
